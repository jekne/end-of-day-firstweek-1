## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

- Writing Javascript (using variables, functions, return values, parameters)
- Working with arrays and objects
- Using array methods (.find, .filter, .map)

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you. You are also allowed to ask for help if you're really stuck, just try to avoid it.

**TIP: Break problems up into smaller problems!** Before writing code make yourself a 'to-do list' or 'battleplan'. Use `console.log()` to help you with debugging!

### ❗ Javascript

Create a file called `index.js` and import the `characters.json` file using `require`.

**A** Select the **4th** character of your characters array and console.log it.

**B** use an array method to locate the character object with id `78` and console.log it.

**C** Console.log an array with only the characters that have `blood: "Half-blood"`.

**BONUS**:

**D** Console.log an array that contains only the `quotes` of each character (so strings, not object)

**E** Console.log an array with all characters that are not "Human".

**F** Console.log an array of all characters whose name **_includes_** "agr" [**Tip here**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes)

The `const` in this section should look something like this:

```js
const characters = require('./characters.json'); // ONLY IMPORT THIS ONCE

// Exercise-Z (fake)
const charNames = characters.map((char) => char.name); //for example
console.log(charNames); // array with only character names.
```
